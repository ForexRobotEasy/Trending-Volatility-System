## Usage

The code consists of several functions that perform specific tasks in the trading system. Here is an overview of each function:

### `trendIndicator()`

This function is responsible for calculating the medium-term trend direction. It needs to be implemented with the logic to determine the trend direction. The function returns the direction of the trend as a double value (+1 for uptrend, -1 for downtrend).

### `signalGenerator(int trendDirection)`

This function generates linear and point signals aligned with the trend direction. It takes the trend direction as an input parameter and needs to be implemented with the logic to generate the signals. The function returns the signal value as a double (-1 for sell, 1 for buy, 0 for no signal).

### `exitSignals(int trendDirection)`

This function generates exit signals for closing trades. It takes the trend direction as an input parameter and needs to be implemented with the logic to generate the exit signals. The function returns the exit signal value as a double (-1 for close sell trades, 1 for close buy trades, 0 for no exit signal).

### `volatilityMarketEntries()`

This function generates market entry signals based on changes in volatility. It needs to be implemented with the logic to generate market entry signals. The function returns the market entry signal value as a double (-1 for sell, 1 for buy, 0 for no signal).

### `OnTick()`

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the code. It calls the other functions to generate signals and performs other trading-related tasks. It needs to be implemented with the logic to execute trades based on the generated signals, close trades based on exit signals, adjust trading parameters based on market conditions, and optimize performance for different time frames and trading instruments.
